Include a readme with whatever you add of how to compile / platform dependencies or whatever other dependencies,
keep your project in the respective language folder inside of its own folder such as master/c++/myproject
also preferably tag it with a name/alias like Hello world -Wendigo or something of the sort but not a requirement
also you can request to add more folders for languages
